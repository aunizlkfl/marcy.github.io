## Challenge

We were given a Unity-based game build with the hint:  
*“I can’t reach the …. Uhukss”*  

I first tried playing the game normally, but there was no clear way to reach the flag.  
Next, I inspected the game folder(gameRev102_Data) with [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper).

## Solution
After loading the game into AssetRipper, I could see the overall project structure:  

There we can see the overall game structure

Unity games store each scene as `levelX`.  
- `level0` → mapped to the main game scene.

- `level1` → mappedd to scene Win

So I opened **level1** file in AssetRipper.  
Inside the **Sprite Data Storage**, I found a sprite named **goal**. This immediately stood out as the place where the flag could be hidden.

Opening the sprite in the **Image tab** revealed the flag text embedded directly inside the asset.
