# Custom MVE bad

## Challenge
You are given a ZIP containing an RPG Maker MV project with many game assets.  
Most files are standard images/audio, but one file stood out: `flaglguess.rpgmvp`. Its extension and contents indicate it is **custom-encrypted/packed** rather than a normal PNG — opening it directly shows binary/garbage data.

Goal: recover the hidden image/flag embedded in the encrypted `.rpgmvp` asset. The challenge tests recognizing RPG Maker MV custom asset packing and using the right tool to restore the image.

## Solution

Upon reviewing the zip files, we try to find flag file and find flaglguess.rpgmvp

We use https://petschko.org/tools/mv_decrypter/index.html#restore-images to recover the file in png and find the flag
